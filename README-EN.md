## Shadowsocks Software Introduction

**SS**, the full name is **Shadowsocks** (hereinafter referred to as `SS`), is a tool for encrypted transmission of network data packets based on the Socks5 proxy method. It can be used for **circumventing censorship** _or bypassing firewall_, and is one of the most stable and commonly used tools for such purposes, **supported across all platforms**.

**SSR** stands for **ShadowsocksR** (hereinafter referred to as `SSR`)
Origin:

> ShadowsocksR is a Shadowsocks fork initiated by breakwa11, which adds some data obfuscation to the original Shadowsocks and claims to fix some security issues and improve QoS priority. Later, contributor Librehat also filled in some similar features for Shadowsocks, even adding Tor-like pluggable transport features.
>
> ShadowsocksR initially had controversies including GPL violations and not distributing source code with binaries. However, the ShadowsocksR project transitioned to the same multiple free software licenses as Shadowsocks, including GPL, Apache License, MIT License, and others.
>
> On July 19, 2017, the ShadowsocksR author breakwa11 reposted a message about the use of SS protocol detection in Shenzhen and widespread forwarding by users, causing panic. On July 24th, breakwa11 released a closed-source passive detection program for SS, which sparked controversy. On July 27, 2017, breakwa11 was subject to personal attacks by an unidentified person claiming to be "ESU.TV," who threatened to release more personal information if development was not stopped and discussions about the event were not ceased. Subsequently, breakwa11 announced that the individual whose personal information had been publicly disclosed was unrelated, and to prevent further harm to unrelated persons, breakwa11 decided to delete all code from GitHub, disband related discussion groups, and stop the ShadowsocksR project. However, the project had already been forked by others and new versions continued to be released, such as SSRR.
